# TanegashimaReactApp

This repository contains TypeScript code for a React app built using Vite. 

This React app hosts a shogi game.

## Testing

`npm run dev` is the recommended way to test changes locally. As the project gets fleshed out, unit tests using Jest and integration tests using Cypress will be added (and other things I tell myself to make myself feel better).
